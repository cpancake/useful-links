# useful-links

I've never used my browser bookmarks well. It's full of junk going back six or seven years at this point, and I can't remember a time where I've found something I've been looking for in my bookmarks. I never even check my bookmarks at this point, really.

In an effort to clean up my bookmarks folder, I'm taking all the useful resources I've bookmarked and putting them here, in this file. At the end of it, maybe I'll have a usable bookmarks folder.

Some of the links I've found are now dead, so I've either found an archive link or found the same info elsewhere. I've noted where that's the case.

## Meta

A list of useful links isn't exactly a unique idea - and I bookmarked some of them.

* [firstsiteguide](https://firstsiteguide.com/tools/) (Used to be called thetoolbox.cc, I don't know if it's the same thing.)

### Skill Books

I don't know what the proper word here is - something longer and broader than a tutorial, but still meant to be read start to finish, unlike a reference book, and not meant to be used in a class, unlike a textbook. I'm just taking "skill book" from The Sims.

* [Beginner's guide to OCaml beginner's guides](http://blog.nullspace.io/beginners-guide-to-ocaml-beginners-guides.html)
